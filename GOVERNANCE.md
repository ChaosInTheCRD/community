# in-toto Governance
This document covers the project's governance and committer process.  The
project consists of the in-toto
[specification](https://github.com/in-toto/docs), multiple implementations, and
the [attestation framework](https://github.com/in-toto/attestation).

## Maintainership and Consensus Builder

The in-toto project is maintained by the people indicated in
[MAINTAINERS.txt](MAINTAINERS.txt). Some in-toto sub-projects and
implementations have maintainers unique to that effort. They are listed in
similar MAINTAINERS.txt files in the corresponding repositories. In general, a
maintainer is expected to (1) submit and review GitHub pull requests and
(2) open issues or
[submit vulnerability reports](https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto#security-issues-and-bugs).
A maintainer has the authority to approve or reject pull requests submitted by
contributors. If a sub-project or implementation has specific responsibilities
for its maintainers, they are listed in that project's MAINTAINERS.txt file.
The maintainers of the in-toto specification, listed in this repository's
[MAINTAINERS.txt](MAINTAINERS.txt) file, can interact with the CNCF on behalf
of the in-toto project.

The project's Consensus Builder (CB), who is also granted all maintainer 
privileges and responsibilities, is Santiago Torres-Arias 
<santiagotorres@purdue.edu, @SantiagoTorres>.  The CB reevaluates the status
of every maintainer of in-toto's specifications, implementations, and other
sub-projects annually.

## Changes in maintainership

Active contributors may be offered or request to be granted maintainer status.
This requires approval from the CB and is done in consultation with the
current maintainers.

Maintainers may be moved to emeritus status.  This is done at the discretion of 
the CB, in consultation with the project maintainers.  Emeritus maintainers are 
listed in the MAINTAINERS.txt file as acknowledgment for their prior service to 
the project, but no longer have code review or other maintainer privileges for 
the project.

## Changes in governance
The CB supervises changes in governance, in consultation with project
maintainers.
