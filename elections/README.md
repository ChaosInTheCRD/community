# ITSC member election process

This document outlines the current process for electing new ITSC members.

## Forming the ITSC

The current consensus builder (Santiago Torres-Arias, Purdue University, @SantiagoTorres) is charged with:

1. Identifying candidates that nominated themselves as part of the initial cohort for the ITSC.
2. Carrying out elections and announcing the winners.

## Election process

Candidates that are self-nominated will be included in the list for members to elect.
The platfrom [CiVS condorcet](https://civs1.civs.us/) will be used to carry out *ranked choice voting*.

## Abuse

The consensus builder will discuss and handle abusive votes by removing them from the tally in an ad-hoc manner.
He will also publicize his thought process and manage appeals by bringing them to the community for discussion.

## Updating this process

This election process is to be updated after the formation of the ITSC.

## Election dates

The current election timeline is the following:

1. Self-nominations will be collected through an issue in the /community repository in the in-toto project's GitHub site on March 6th, 2023
2. Nominations will be collected until March 15th
2. The election site will be collected until March 31st, 2023
